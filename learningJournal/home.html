                <h1>My new journey as a bootcamp student.</h1>
                <p>After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, I've made the big jump
                    over to the Bootcamp to
                    get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.

                    <strong>How I stay committed to learning</strong>
                    <p class="post-body">I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning,
                        then
                        try
                        to
                        create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
                    </p>
                    <p>While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was
                        learning
                        and most things
                        about my
                        journey with the world.</p>
                </div>
                <div><strong>How I got started</strong>
                    <p class="post-body">I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I
                        was
                        learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I
                        learned
                        but
                        also
                        write short summaries of what learned using my own words.</p>
                    <p>That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my
                        learning
                        summaries was
                        also
                        helping others learn and stay motivated.</p>
